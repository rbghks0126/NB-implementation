Python Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier

This is a python implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier made for university project.
It is an extension of the simple Naive Bayes version as it handles both discrete (ordinal and nominal) and numeric/continuous features without the need to convert feature data types beforehand.
Numeric features are assumed to have a normal/gaussian distribution.
