Python Implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier

This is a python implementation of the Naive Bayes classifier made for university project.
Naive Bayes classifier is a machine learning classification algorithm which learns to predict the class (label) of new instances from a training set. It trains under the assumption that the features are independent from each other.


It is an extension of the simple Naive Bayes version as it handles both discrete (ordinal and nominal) and numeric/continuous features without the need to convert feature data types beforehand.
Numeric features are assumed to have a normal/gaussian distribution.
